=================================================================================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dradis/dradis-osvdb.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/dradis/dradis-osvdb)

OSVDB is an independent and open source database created by and for the
community. Our goal is to provide accurate, detailed, current, and unbiased 
technical information." - http://osvdb.org/

This plugin provides search filters to query the OSVDB from within the
[Dradis Framework](https://github.com/dradis/dradisframework). The plugin makes
use of the API provided by OSVDB (http://osvdb.org/api).

You will need to register in their site to get an API key: 
http://osvdb.org/account/signup

Once you have your key, add it as osvdb:api_key in through the Configuration
Manager.

The plugin requires Dradis 3.0 or higher.
